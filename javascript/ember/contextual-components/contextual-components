Yield specific content:
we can yield specific content in to a component with
template:
{{#collapsible-panel as |person|}}
	{{person.firstName}}
	{{person.lastName}}
{{/collapsible-panel}}

using the hash helper
template collapsible-panel:
{{yield (hash firstName='Marcell' lastName='Cruz')}}

we can also yield components inside the hash with
{{yield (hash
	header=(component 'collapsible-panel-header') 
	body=(component 'collapsible-panel-body')}}

now we can use the yield components:
{{#collapsible-panel as |panel|}}
	{{panel.header on-click=(action (toggle 'isOpen' this))}}
	{{panel.body isOpen=true}}
{{/collapsible-panel}}

configuring nested component:
we can pass aditional options to the nested component 
{{yield (hash
	header=(component 'collapsible-panel-header' 
		on-click=(action (toggle 'isOpen' this))) 
	body=(component 'collapsible-panel-body' isOpen=true)}}

now we don't have to declare this options everytime we use the contextual
component, the header must implenent toggle tough

flexibility vs incapsulation:
you must strive to keep most of the properties private,
that way you don't lock yourself with these properties in the future

when to use contextual component:
try to use contextual component as little as possible, 
only use contextual components when you have nested components that 
share data.
