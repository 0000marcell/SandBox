  p.
    The JSONAPISerializer expects you backend to return a JSON API document
    that follows the JSONAPI specifications 
    all type names should be pluralized and all attributes and relationships dash-cased 
    a response with more than one record should have a array in its data property

    sideloading data: 
    data that is not part of the main request but include relationships should be put 
    inside the include key:

//- this is a example...

    response to /people/123
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "people",

        "attributes": {
          "first-name": "Jeff",
          "last-name": "Atwood"
        }
      }
    }

    response with more than one record 
    {
