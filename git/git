workflow:
create a new branch for each issue being worked, master will always be updated with remote master of the 
main project, everytime we wish to work on a issue we will create a new branch from master, work on this 
new branch, create a remote branch with the same name and push to this remote branch, then make a pr based on 
this new branch
