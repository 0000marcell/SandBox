programming is just state and processes.

to better understand code we need to start from the bottom and make 
our way up the abstract, we first try to understand the properties
and what state these properties save, then we understand the processes(methods) that
change the state of these properties

one of the biggest headache in sofware development is lack of docs and tests,
when you don't have docs and tests is too hard to understand the code, so we enter try and error mode
which is a very slow method of programming.

ways to more quickly understand code bases

1 find the entry point 
2 write a description for every property on the method
3 write a description for every method
4 write a description for the entire module
5 when writing the descriptions first start just writing what the code does
  then after having a better notion of what the method do rewrite, with what it 
  accomplishes and not exacly what the code is doing, try to relate it with
  other parts of the code
