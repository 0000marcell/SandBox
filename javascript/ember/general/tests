to manually create a test in ember we just need to create a file under tests/ and name it *something*-test.js

moduleFor runs a strip down version of ember with just the modules we request throught the needs property

moduleForAcceptance, runs the entire application and we can have access to the ember server

is also possible to use the before hook to inject ember-mirage http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/v0.2.0-beta.4/manually-starting-mirage/

the container property in the moduleFor is the ember app, we can use lookup to find any container like 'service:store'
'serializer:application' etc...

another way to tests serializers is through http://thejsguy.com/2015/11/04/testing-serializers-in-ember.html
