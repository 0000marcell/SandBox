gemfile structure: Rakefile, README, document.gemspec, lib/document.rb, spec/document_spec.rb

more than one src file: if we have more than one src file we just create a folder inside lib/ with the same name as the gem and put other files there, them in require everything from the one .rb file inside lib/ ex: thor/lib/thor/ thor/lib/thor.rb <- file with the requires

gemspec: the spec file contains all the metadata about the gem and its dependencies like in npm's package.json

building the gem: after having all the above we run gem build document.gem 

upload a gem: to upload a gem you need to have a gemcutter accont and download the gemcutter gem, then push the gem with gem push document-1.0.0.gem

mind the paths: when requiring a file that will be used in a gem we need to be mindfull of the path of this file, use __FILE__ to avoid wrong paths in your gems

wrap the gem in a module to avoid name colisions

rake tasks: create rake spec, rake build and rake release

history.rdoc: update this file with all the information about new releases, bugfixes, hotfixes etc using semver
