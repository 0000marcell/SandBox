enumerables: the enumerable mixin provied a collection of classes with several traversal and search methods 

word array: use %w{ marcell monteiro cruz } 

arbitraty number of arguments:
def method(*args) asterostic before a argument transforms the argument in a array, this is also called starred argument or splat names

named parameter: we can use hash in the last parameter to simulate named parameters

inject: inject is similar to reduce in js, you pass a initial value and the result of each black call is passed to the next

bang !: in enumerables methods in most enumerables means change in place

tap: goes into a object when creating to perform another operation ex
		obj = Program.new.tap {|obj| obj.name = 'this_name' }
