The route-action helper allows you to bubble closure actions, which will delegate it to the currently active route hierarchy per the bubbling rules explained under actions. Like closure actions, route-action will also have a return value.
However, returning true in an action will not preserve bubbling semantics. In case you would like that behavior, you should use ordinary string actions instead.
