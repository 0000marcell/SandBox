webrick: is an HTTP server toolkit that can be configured as an HTTPS server, a proxy server, and a virtual-host server

starting an HTTP server:
server = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new :Port => 8000, :DocumentRoot => root 
trap 'INT' do server.shutdown end
server.start
we need to provide a shutdown hook as starting the server blocks the current thread
