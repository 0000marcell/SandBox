doorkeeper can be configure in config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb

doorkeepers adds tables in the db and a use_doorkeeper helper on the routes that 
adds the necessary routes

One of these routes is oauth/token, you do a post with login information to 
this endpoint to create a new token

I can use doorkeeper_authorize!() inside a controller to authenticate the user see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36547315/access-doorkeeper-from-action-rails-controller

We can create token manually via 
token = Doorkeeper::AccessToken.create(
  resource_owner_id: new_user.id,
  application_id: app.id,
  scopes: 'public'
)

Difference between devise and doorkeeper:
devise is a authentication service, doorkeeper is authorization service, giving access to user and application through a token
